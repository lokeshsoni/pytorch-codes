    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/overfitting.png' width=450px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The network learns the training set better and better, resulting in lower training losses. However, it starts having problems generalizing to data outside the training set leading to the validation loss increasing. The ultimate goal of any deep learning model is to make predictions on new data, so we should strive to get the lowest validation loss possible. One option is to use the version of the model with the lowest validation loss, here the one around 8-10 training epochs. This strategy is called *early-stopping*. In practice, you'd save the model frequently as you're training then later choose the model with the lowest validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method to reduce overfitting (outside of early-stopping) is *dropout*, where we randomly drop input units. This forces the network to share information between weights, increasing it's ability to generalize to new data. Adding dropout in PyTorch is straightforward using the [`nn.Dropout`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Dropout) module.\n",

This sets the model to evaluation mode where the dropout probability is 0. You can turn dropout back on by setting the model to train mode with `model.train()`.
